# Image Classification Web Application

## Overview

This repository presents a full-stack web application designed for image classification tasks. It integrates a Python-based backend with a React frontend, facilitating users to upload images and receive classification predictions seamlessly.

## Features

-   **User-Friendly Interface**: A responsive frontend built with React, enabling intuitive image uploads and displaying classification results effectively.
-   **Robust Backend**: A Python-powered backend that processes incoming images and returns accurate classification predictions.
-   **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design allowing for easy integration of various machine learning models and datasets.

## Technologies Employed

-   **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
-   **Backend**: Python, Flask (or an equivalent web framework)
-   **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on implementation specifics)

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm installed for frontend development
-   Python 3.x and pip installed for backend development

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Launch the backend server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3500`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend/my-app
    ```

2. Install the necessary Node.js packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React development server:

    ```bash
    PORT=3501 npm start
    ```

    The frontend application will run on `http://localhost:3501`.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Upload an image using the provided interface.
3. View the predicted class label returned by the backend server.
